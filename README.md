# OneUp Learning SDK

This is a Python SDK to allow for the scripting and integration of the [OneUp Learning platform](https://oneup.wssu.edu/login) developed by West-Salem State University.

## Configuration

You can request an account by contacting [Darina Dicheva](https://www.wssu.edu/profiles/dichevad/index.html). Once you have an account, create a `config.yaml` file containing your authentication information. This file is parsed by the SDK to authenticate your API calls.

```yaml
oneup:
  username: "username"
  password: "OneUP-P4ssW04d!"
```
